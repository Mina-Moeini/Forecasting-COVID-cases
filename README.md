# Forecasting COVID cases with ML/DL models

This worldwide pandemic impacts hundreds of thousands of people and causes thousands of deaths each day.
Predicting the number of new cases (you can do the same for new deaths too) during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and facilities required in the future. 
Data from this https://www.data.gouv.fr supplied by SantÃ© Publique France (Public Health France).
This project aims to evaluate the performance and compare of linear and  multiple non-linear regression techniques and neural network architecture, such as linear regression, support-vector regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor,LSTM,RNN,for COVID-19 new cases rate prediction .
The performance of reproduction rate prediction is measured mean squared error (MSE).


## Prerequisites
Time series forecasting problems should be re-framed as supervised learning problems.
The important concepts that it's better you know.
